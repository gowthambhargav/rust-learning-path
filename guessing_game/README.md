Okay, let's imagine this code is like a fun guessing game! Here's how it works:

- The computer thinks of a secret number between 1 and 100.
- You try to guess what that number is.
- Every time you make a guess, the computer tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or just right!
- If you guess correctly, you win the game!
- If you want to stop playing, you can type "quit" and the game will end.

The code is like a set of instructions that tells the computer how to play this game with you. It's using a special language called Rust that computers can understand.

So, when you run this code, you'll be able to play this guessing game with your computer. It's a fun way to practice your number skills and have a little competition with the computer!
